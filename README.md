# Machine-Learning-Projects

This was my practice test with using SKlearn's built in SGDRegressor function to create a multivariable regression model of the student performance data. This was my first model to give decent predictive power. My target variable was the reading score and I discovered that the writing score was the largest influence and that most other variables had little influence on my model. I also discovered that the elasticnet function could perform with almost the same accuracy but achieved the finished model in a quicker time.
